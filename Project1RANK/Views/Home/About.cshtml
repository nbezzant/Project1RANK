<h2>About Mission Central</h2>

<p>
    Mission Central was founded in 2003 by Ryan Gosling. Although he left the church to pursue a career in acting,
    which you may have seen him in movies like "The Notebook." He loved missionaries and wanted to help them succeed.
    That is why he created Mission Central. Since 2003, we have made lots of progress and helped over 200,000 missionaries
    thus far. Including President Nelson's granddaughter's cousin's bestfriend! Our aim and goals has always been the same,
    "help missionaries succeed and preach the gospel, without breaking most of the rules in the missionary handbook." We are
    a family centered group as we believe that families can be together forever. Even if you don't want to be with them that
    long!
